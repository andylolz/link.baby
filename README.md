At the end of a meetup or event, it’s really tempting to set up a [mailing list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list) / [slack](https://slack.com/) / [whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com) group etc to “keep the conversation going”. But for a number of reasons, these rarely work out.

Instead:

 1. the facilitator shares the email addresses of attendees with [link.baby](https://link.baby), along with some introductory email copy.
 2. [link.baby](https://link.baby) contacts all participants with the facilitator’s introductory email. Participants are asked to opt in by clicking a link and providing a short bio.
 3. Those who opt in then receive a series of emails from [link.baby](https://link.baby) – one per day – introducing them to a different attendee
 4. Participants can opt out at any time, using the opt out link
